    <!-- ABOUT ME SECTION WITH FLORAL BORDER -->
    <section class="about-container floral-border">

        <p><strong>🌷 Hi! I’m Sienna — a Tampa‑born, Denver‑raised tech rookie with a love for all things pink, cozy, and curious. 🌸✨</strong> I moved to Colorado when I was 14, and somewhere between the mountains, the sunshine, and the people around me who made technology feel fun, I found myself falling into the world of IT.</p>

        <p>🌼 I’m still early in my tech journey, learning one concept (and sometimes one bug) at a time. This blog is where I document what I’m picking up along the way — the wins, the mistakes, the “aha!” moments, and the things I wish someone had told me sooner. 🌱💡</p>

        <p>🌺 When I’m not tinkering with code or trying to understand why my server suddenly stopped cooperating, you’ll probably find me doing one of my favorite things:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🌸☕ Sipping coffee</li>
            <li>🌼🌞 Walking in the sun and recharging my brain</li>
            <li>🌷📚 Getting lost in a good book</li>
            <li>🌺🧘‍♀️ Unwinding with yoga to balance out the chaos of learning tech</li>
        </ul>

        <p>💐 I like to think all these little joys fuel my curiosity and keep me grounded while I grow in IT. 💗</p>

        <p><strong>🌸✨ Welcome to my digital pink corner — a space where learning is messy, fun, and always sprinkled with a bit of sparkle. ✨🌸</strong></p>
